# Web Interface

The Web Interface is the primary way to interact with Axiom: send messages, watch background tasks, edit memory, manage providers and skills, and tune behavior in Settings.

With the default Docker Compose setup, you open it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you changed `HOST_PORT` in your `.env`, use that port instead.

> **Admin vs. user.** Most pages are admin-only — only users with role `admin` see them. Regular users land on **Chat** and stay there. The locked screen on every other page is intentional: an Axiom deployment is single-tenant by design, and configuration is the operator's job.

## Layout

The app shell has three regions:

- **Sidebar (left)** — version badge, navigation, and the user menu at the bottom. Collapses to an icon-only rail on narrow desktop windows and to a slide-over drawer on mobile.
- **Page header** — title, subtitle, and per-page action buttons (refresh, save, create…). On mobile the buttons teleport into the global header bar to save vertical space.
- **Page body** — whatever the current page renders.

The sidebar is the canonical map of the interface. Every entry below has its own dedicated page in this section, except for **Settings** — that one is large enough to have its own [Settings](../settings/) tree.

## Pages

| Sidebar entry                    | What it's for                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Dashboard](./dashboard)         | Operations overview — provider health, activity today, active tasks, recent health checks. |
| [Chat](./chat)                   | The main agent conversation. Streaming, attachments, voice input/output, thinking level.   |
| [Tasks](./tasks)                 | List, inspect, kill, and restart background tasks.                                         |
| [Cronjobs](./cronjobs)           | Create, edit, and manage recurring scheduled tasks and reminders.                          |
| [Memory](./memory)               | Edit `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, daily notes, user profiles, and the wiki.                     |
| [Activity Logs](./activity-logs) | Browse historical agent activity — tool calls, sessions, and errors.                       |
| [Token Usage](./token-usage)     | Token consumption and estimated cost broken down by provider, model, and time range.       |
| [Users](./users)                 | Add, remove, and manage local accounts and Telegram-linked users.                          |
| [Providers](./providers)         | Configure LLM providers and pick the active default model.                                 |
| [Skills](./skills)               | Install, inspect, and toggle skills. Browse the built-in tool catalog.                     |
| [Instructions](./instructions)   | Edit `AGENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, and `CONSOLIDATION.md` — the agent's behavior rules. |
| [Settings](../settings/)         | Runtime configuration — provider, scheduler, telegram, voice, secrets, etc.                |

## Conventions across all pages

A few patterns recur on almost every admin page. Knowing them once means every page reads faster:

- **Page header with a single primary action.** The header carries the page title and at most one or two primary buttons (`Refresh`, `Save`, `New …`). Destructive actions live inside row menus, never in the header.
- **Save is explicit.** Forms (Settings, Cronjobs, Providers, Memory editors) never auto-save. You see exactly what changes when you click `Save`.
- **Confirm dialogs for destructive actions.** Killing a task, deleting a cronjob, removing a user, or resetting memory always goes through a `ConfirmDialog`. Destructive confirm buttons are styled red.
- **Polling, not WebSockets, for list pages.** Tasks, Activity Logs, and the Dashboard refresh every few seconds via a poll loop. The Chat page is the exception — it uses a persistent WebSocket so messages stream live.
- **Empty states are helpful, not loud.** Every list page has an empty state with an icon, a one-line title, and a sentence explaining what would put rows there.

## Where to next?

- New to the app? Start with [Dashboard](./dashboard) for the lay of the land, then move to [Chat](./chat).
- Want to understand what runs in the background? [Tasks](./tasks) and [Cronjobs](./cronjobs).
- Need to configure something? Jump straight to [Settings](../settings/).
